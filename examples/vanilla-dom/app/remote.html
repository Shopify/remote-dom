      The ES modules version of remote-ui tries to support the lowest-common
      denominator, and so transpiles away async functions. It of course distributes
      a version that preserves these language features so you can compile it to
      match your own browser support, but the version the CDN uses requires us
      to have the regenerator global available, so we import that here.

    <!--
      This JavaScript will will generate UI and communicate it to the host,
      which in this case is the parent window.
