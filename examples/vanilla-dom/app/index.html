      <p>
        This button is rendered by <code>remote-ui</code>. You can’t tell, but
        there’s a hidden <code>iframe</code> on this page that is communicating
        the UI it wants to render over <code>postMessage()</code>. The main page
        is the only thing that can access the message you entered, but it gives
        access to that value by passing a function into the <code>iframe</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Check out the (entirely unbundled!) code in the
        <a href="./host.js">host.js</a> and
        <a href="./remote.js">remote.js</a> JavaScript files, which are loaded
        on the main page and <code>iframe</code>, respectively.
      </p>

    <!--
      We use an iframe as the remote environment here, because it supports
      modules in most modern browsers. Aside from support for ES modules, there
      is nothing that prevents us from instead using a web worker as the remote
      environment. Note that, without using a separate domain, or manually
      hiding globals within the iframe, we are not actually creating a “safe”
      sandbox here, as the remote code can reach up into the parent.
    -->
    <iframe
      src="./remote.html"
      sandbox="allow-scripts"
      style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute;"
    ></iframe>

    <!--
      This JavaScript will connect to the iframe, and begin propagating UI updates
      into the UI element above.
