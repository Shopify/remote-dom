# Contributing

## [Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All contributors **must** adhere to the code of conduct. Read the [full text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to remote-ui, some of which are:

- Filing bug reports or requesting new features by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/issues/new)
- Hacking on an issue from our [backlog](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/issues)
- Improving tests, documentation, or examples

## Development

### Getting started

Clone this repo, then run `yarn install`. This repo uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for package management, and [lerna](https://lerna.js.org) for publishing multiple packages out of a single repo (a “monorepo”). The codebase is entirely written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

### Development tasks

remote-ui uses [sewing-kit](https://github.com/lemonmade/sewing-kit), a work-in-progress extraction of some of Shopify’s front-end build tools, for all development tasks. You will see `sewing-kit.config.ts` files at the root of the repo, and for each package, which control the way those packages are built, tested, and more.

#### Type check

Run `yarn type-check`, which will run TypeScript’s `tsc` command on the repo.

This repo uses [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html), with each package represented as a project, as well as one project for all the non-source code files (tests, config, etc). Make sure you understand how to configure the `tsconfig.json` of projects, like setting the `references` key to include the path to any other packages whose types a given project depends on.

#### Lint

Run `yarn lint`, which will run the entire codebase through [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

#### Test

Run `yarn test`, which will run all tests in the repo in [jest’s](https://jestjs.io) watch mode.

Tests are currently a little sparse, focused mostly on ensuring good end-to-end behavior when using all the libraries together. Additional tests can be added for public APIs in each package by including files with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension. Make sure you adhere to the structure of the other tests in the repo, and it would be extra appreciated if you understand a little about [Shopify’s approach to front-end testing](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundation/blob/master/handbook/Best%20practices/Testing.md).

#### Build

To build all the package outputs for the repo, run `yarn build`. This command builds multiple versions of each package. Some of these versions, like the `.esnext` version of the project you will see, preserve most of the original source code, so that build tools can be configured to parse, process, polyfill, and minify this code in the same way the rest of an application’s codebase. This helps to significantly reduce the bundle size of these packages.

`yarn build` is automatically run before the project is published. You only need to run it manually when you want to verify the outputs it produces (all of which are ignored in `git`).

### Contributing a change

If this is your first contribution to a project on GitHub, you may find this [free video series on contributing to open source useful](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

If you are fixing a minor issue, feel free to send a pull request directly. If you are working on a non-trivial bug or feature, though, we’d appreciate if you could first [open an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/issues) so we can make sure the process goes smoothly. If you are taking on an issue, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it.

**Before submitting a pull request**, please:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`
1. Run `yarn install` from the repository root
1. Make sure your changes do not cause errors to be thrown when running `yarn test`, `yarn lint`, or `yarn type-check` (these will also be checked automatically when you open your pull request, as they run as part of remote-ui’s [GitHub Action-based CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yml))
1. Add a description of your changes to the [consolidated changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
1. If you haven’t already, [sign a Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.shopify.com/)

#### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Each contributor is required to [sign a CLA](https://cla.shopify.com/). This process is automated as part of your first pull request and is only required once. If any contributor has not signed or does not have an associated GitHub account, the CLA check will fail and the pull request is unable to be merged.

### Releasing changes

Currently, only developers with access to Shopify’s internal tools can tag new versions and publish releases. We’ll automatically publish new versions as pull requests are merged, but we ask that you suggest the type of version change you expect a package to need as the result of your changes. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), with each package individually-versioned.

For Shopify developers doing a release, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch off `main`.
1. On your new branch, run `yarn version-bump` and select new versions for all packages.
1. Ensure that any packages with meaningful version changes have corresponding updates to their collocated `CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Push your changes to the `origin` remote, ensuring you also `--follow-tags`.
1. Open a PR for your new branch, and get it approved and merged.
1. After merging, visit the [shipit stack](https://shipit.shopify.io/shopify/remote-ui/production) and deploy your commit. This will publish the new versions to the npm registry.
