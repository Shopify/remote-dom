# `@remote-ui/web-workers`

This package has been deprecated. If you are looking for an ergonomic way to create web workers in a project using [`@remote-ui/rpc`](../rpc), Webpack, and Babel, we recommend you use [`@shopify/web-worker`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/main/packages/web-worker), which has the same API as version `1.3.0` of this library.
